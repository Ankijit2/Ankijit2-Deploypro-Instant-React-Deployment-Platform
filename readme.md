## üìã Components

### 1. **Client**
- **Frontend** built with Next.js and styled using shadcn/ui.
- Provides an intuitive interface for managing projects, viewing logs, and monitoring deployment status.

### 2. **API**
- Handles project creation, build initiation, and log management.
- Triggers Docker containers to run the build process, 
- Logs from the container are streamed via **Kafka** and stored in **ClickHouse** for real-time monitoring.

### 3. **Proxy**
- Acts as an HTTP proxy to serve deployed projects.
- Workflow:
  1. Matches incoming subdomain requests with project records in **PostgreSQL**.
  2. Fetches the corresponding HTML, CSS, and JS files from **AWS S3**.
  3. Serves the assets via **CloudFront**, ensuring fast and reliable delivery.

### 4. **Build**
- A Dockerized build system that:
- Runs user projects in isolated containers.
 -  Automatically identifies and installs project dependencies.
  - Detects and blocks malicious commands in build scripts.
  - Builds the project and uploads the generated assets (HTML, CSS, JS) to an **S3 bucket**.
  - Logs build processes and errors for debugging.

## üìÇ Project Workflow

1. **Project Creation**
   - Users create a new project via the frontend.
   - The backend generates a unique subdomain for the project and stores metadata in **PostgreSQL**.

2. **Build Process**
   - The API triggers a Docker container to build the project.
   - After a successful build:
     - Static assets are uploaded to **S3**.
     - The subdomain mapping is updated in **PostgreSQL**.

3. **Serving the Application**
   - When a user visits the subdomain:
     - The **Proxy** checks the subdomain against the database.
     - Fetches the assets from **S3**.
     - Serves them to the user via **CloudFront**.

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Logs from the build process are streamed using **Kafka**.
   - Logs are stored in **ClickHouse** and visualized in the frontend for real-time monitoring.
